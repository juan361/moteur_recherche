But I've had one too many cigarettes burning up my lungs
Had the taste of one too many lips hanging of my tongue, oh, oh
Sunday morning getting high, drinking here alone
Thinking up a brand new alibi for not coming home, oh, oh
And I'm sorry I lie so much
I'm not a saint, but I could be if I tried
Lord knows I've got habits to break
I'm really good at being good at goodbyes
I'm gonna give you fair warning that I
I'm not a saint, but I could be if I tried
Lord knows I don't learn from mistakes
And I'm not here unless I'm here by your side
I'm not a saint, but I could be if I
Sover up and settle down, give a little talk
'Bout how I can't keep from runnin' 'round
Say it's such a fault, oh, oh
And I'm sorry I lie so much
I'm not a saint, but I could be if I tried
Lord knows I've got habits to break
I'm really good at being good at goodbyes
I'm gonna give you fair warning that I
I'm not a saint, but I could be if I tried
Lord knows I don't learn from mistakes
And I'm not here unless I'm here by your side
I'm not a saint, but I could be if I tried
Oh woah, oh woah, oh
Oh woah, oh woah, oh
Oh woah, oh woah, oh
I'm gonna give you fair warning that I
Will be the reason for the tears in your eyes
I'm not a saint, but I could be if I tried
Lord knows I've got habits to break
I'm really good at being good at goodbyes
I'm gonna give you fair warning that I
I'm not a saint, but I could be if I tried
Lord knows I don't learn from mistakes
And I'm not here unless I'm here by your side
I'm gonna give you fair warning that I
Oh woah, oh woah, oh
Oh woah, oh woah, oh
Oh woah, oh woah, oh
I'm not a saint, but I could be if I tried

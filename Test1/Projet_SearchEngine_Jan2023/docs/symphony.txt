"Nature's Symphony"

The birds chirp in harmony
With the rustle of leaves in the breeze
The sun casts its warm rays
As the world awakens from its slumber

The flowers bloom in vibrant hues
A rainbow of colors on display
The bees buzz, busy at work
Collecting nectar for their honey

The rivers flow, never still
A constant melody, never-ending
The mountains stand tall and proud
A natural fortress, unchanging

The clouds roll by, fluffy and white
A canvas for the sun to paint
The rain patters against the ground
A symphony of sound, so quaint

The wind howls, a haunting tune
As it dances through the trees
The thunder rumbles, a bass line
Nature's symphony, a masterpiece

The moon rises, a glowing orb
A guiding light in the dark
The stars twinkle, a symphony of light
A cosmic work of art

Nature's symphony, forever playing
A symphony for all to hear
It's a concert for the ages
A symphony without compare

It's all around, it's in our hearts
Nature's symphony, it never stops

With each new day, it starts again
A new movement, a new melody

Nature's symphony, forever singing
With no beginning and no end
The beauty of nature, it keeps on playing
A symphony for all to comprehend.

William Carlos Williams, “ The Red Wheelbarrow ”

The most anthologized poem of the last 25 years for a reason. See also: “ This is Just to Say,” which, among other things, has spawned a host of memes and parodies.

T. S. Eliot, “ The Waste Land ”

Without a doubt one of the most important poems of the 20th century. “ It has never lost its glamour,” Paul Muldoon observed. “ It has never failed to be equal to both the fracture of its own era and what, alas, turned out to be the even greater fracture of the ongoing 20th century and now, it seems, the 21st century.” See also: “ The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.”

Robert Frost, “ The Road Not Taken ”

Otherwise known as “ the most misread poem in America. ” See also: “ Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening. ” And “ Birches. ” All begin in delight and end in wisdom, as Frost taught us great poems should.

Gwendolyn Brooks, “ We Real Cool”

This blew my mind in high school, and I wasn’t the only one.

Elizabeth Bishop, “ One Art”

Bishop’s much loved and much discussed ode to loss, which Claudia Roth Pierpont called “ a triumph of control, understatement, wit. Even of self-mockery, in the poetically pushed rhyme word “ vaster,” and the ladylike, pinkies-up “ shan’t.” An exceedingly rare mention of her mother—as a woman who once owned a watch. A continent standing in for losses larger than itself.”

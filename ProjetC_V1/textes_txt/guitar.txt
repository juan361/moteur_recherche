You should tune up every time you play, so we recommend using an electronic tuner. Hardware tuners start at about $5 and there are several free smartphone apps you can use, too. All you have to remember is the order of the strings ( fat to thin: EADGBE) so you know that you’re definitely tuning to the right note. Tighten the string with the string’s tuning nut to raise the pitch, or loosen it to lower the pitch. 
You can also tune your guitar without a tuner so it’s in tune with itself. To tune the fifth ( A) string, play the 5th fret of the sixth string and the open fifth string. These two notes should sound the same. Repeat this process for every string except the second ( B) string, where you should tune to the 4th fret of the third ( G) string.

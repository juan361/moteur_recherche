"The Test of Code"

The lines of code, a labyrinthine maze
A puzzle to solve, a challenge to face
The compiler runs, with a steady pace
Checking for errors, in this digital space

The bugs lurk, hidden deep within
A test to discover, where to begin
The test cases run, with purpose and spin
Checking for faults, before the code goes live

The debuggers search, for the source of the glitch
The log files scroll, an endless pitch
Patience and persistence, the keys to the glitch
It's a test of the mind, a test of the itch

The program runs, with a smooth, fluid flow
A test of time, a test of the slow
The load balancers, with a steady go
A test of the system, a test of the load

The code is deployed, to the user's delight
A test of the market, a test of the right
The feedback comes, a beacon of light
A test of the customer, a test of the insight

It's a test of the code, a test of the craft
A test of the skills, a test of the daft
It's a test of the journey, a test of the path
A test that never ends, a test that lasts.

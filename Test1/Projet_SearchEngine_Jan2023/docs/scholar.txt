"The Scholar's Woes"

The books pile high, the papers mount
A never-ending quest, to figure it out
The late nights, the endless doubt
A scholar's life, a constant drought

The deadlines loom, the pressure builds
A test of the mind, a test of the wills
The stress takes its toll, the fatigue it spills
A test of the spirit, a test of the ills

The brain aches, the eyes strain
A test of the limits, a test of the pain
The passion wanes, the spark wanes
A test of the heart, a test of the strains

The passion fades, the motivation dips
A test of the willpower, a test of the grips
The purpose lost, the direction rips
A test of the soul, a test of the quips

It's a test of the scholar, a test of the burn
A test of the journey, a test of the turn
It's a test that never ends, a test that yearns
A test of the scholar's woes, a test that churns.

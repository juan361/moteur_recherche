I don't feel safe in this bed
There are voices in my head
I've been talking to the dead
And the fear baptised me
My kingdom turned to dust
And I watched all my riches rust
Have I lost the Midas' touch?
Or do sad eyes blind me?

Over and over we go
Over the hills and the valleys bellow
Oh, and it follows me, follows me home
And it suffocates me, hmmm

Oh, I can't breath
I said oh, I can't breath
All I know is I forgot how to be me

I don't feel safe in the halls
There are bruises on the walls
There are bodies in the floors
And they breathe so loudly
I wish I could move
Get up and walk right out this tomb
Do our saviours die too soon?
For my sins surround me

Over and over we go
( Over and over we go)
Over the hills and the valleys below
( Over the hills and the valleys below)
Oh, and it follows me, follows me home
( Follows me, follows me)
And it suffocates me, hmmm

Oh, I can't breath
I said oh, I can't breath
All I know is I forgot how to be me
Halleluja
Where is my God, where are you?
Halleluja
Nothing is pulling me through
Halleluja
When I don't know how to be
Halleluja
I forgot how to be me

When he gave up the fight
A quick decision late in the night
That stayed with me for all of my life
I miss you so
